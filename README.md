Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!



What I like most about version control is that it lets you track every change, experiment fearlessly, and revert back anytime — giving you full confidence in your code history.



What I find most frustrating is merge conflicts: when multiple people change the same lines, resolving them can be tedious and error-prone, especially in large files or complex projects.
